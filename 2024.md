# 2024 resolutions

#1. Get a 3D printer

I've wanted a 3D printer for a long time. It will help with prototyping for projects I want to make, replace parts of things that are currently broken (my headphones have plastic parts that snapped, but they are impeccable otherwise, for example), and just other cool stuff other people have made (hextraction, I'm looking at you).

#2. Fix Minigame Investigator's merge problems

I have not made a public release of any alpha builds of Minigame Investigator in YEARS. I have jotted down notes, I have drawn character concepts, I have written and re-written whole sections of the story (with.... admittedly not great dialogue....), I have written music pieces (that were lost when my last SSD corrupted, including the title screen music - make backups, kids!), but the biggest problem making things slow was... a merge conflict.

I will probably elaborate on a public blog post explaining why it's been so long, but while I was working on the next update, I thought of adding new instrument samples - which I still want to do, but in hindsight probably in a polishing phase that is NOT NOW - and I couldn't. Apparently, the tools that are available right now on [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) aren't in my old version.

It is a good practise to, when you're making a project that is a fork of another, to have a main fork that is literally just the current version of the project you're basing it off of and whatever features you are working on, you make a specified branch. It's clear that M.I. was my first experience with GitHub in recent memory, and of course, I did not know that.

Mistakes happen, we learn from them. Now I have to research how to get pokeemerald to be the new "root" (if that is even possible), and either abandon the current version and add the features I currently have (which sounds fast, but will leave that old branch stale) or I can fix the merge conflicts that have been the bane of my existence ever since I stopped working on M.I.

Needless to say, the first option is a lot better. I can't work on it during January because exams exist, but February sounds perfect.

#3. Read all of the FNaF books

I made [a YouTube channel all about FNaF](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair) and started working on it WAAAY back, but never got the time to research, write, voice and edit those videos.

I have recently gotten an e-book from a friend - Speed Reading by Kam Knight - and I'm hoping that THAT will make the research part of that process just a tad easier.

You would expect a guy that's making a fan game about the lore to have read all the books, but according to my estimations it would realistically take me around 123 hours of reading to complete them all, and I still have all the other stuff computer engineering students do like play videogames, do homework, study and hang out with friends (yes, surprisingly we have them). And you know, I want to be able to concieve maker projects (for which that 3D printer will be very useful)

#4. Get a job at a maker workshop

Last year I got to visit a workshop that teaches kids the basics of electric circuits, basic sewing, all these crazy things you can do with paper, little robots that you can learn to program with, chain reaction machines, etcetera and I felt like THAT was somewhere I could live in, you know? It didn't take me too long to be absolutely astounded and ask how I could apply for a job there, even as a university student.

I soon got the basics down, but I shouldn't apply until I am free to start, which I won't be until February. However, getting to work there as a part-time job is undoubtedly a goal for this year.

#5. Make that video about my experiences with Linux

Since I changed my computer and decided to use Linux Mint as my OS, a recurring viewer of my streams, MasterSam4508, suggested I make a video about my experiences with Linux - where to start, what's better than Windows, what's worse, etcetera.

This is an amazing idea. I really, REALLY want to make that video. However, before that I still want to make videos for [Jackie's Despair](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair). In part, because I need practise with video editors here, in part because I also want to make FNaF videos on my free time.

#6. Make a push to become just a bit more secure

Last year, I decided that I wanted to be tracked... less. I know privacy is not completely achievable, but sometimes one push is all it takes.

And that's it!

1, 2, 3 and 6 are all "goal-starting goals", they obviously precede any REAL goals, but they're there for me to know what to do. They are not big (I already have the money for the 3D printer, have been saving up from my last jobs and gifts; making progress on Minigame Investigator is something I owe myself as a FNaF fan and reading the books is not unrealistic with a higher reading speed; that would also mean I would be reading at least 3+11+8=32 books, with Felix the Shark, 33, all in one year, which is more than some people's reading resolutions)

4 and 5 are actually boolean goals that do not result in anything else (I either got or didn't get the job, I either made the video or didn't) but I'm willing to leave 5 for the end of the year so I can document "a year with Linux"

6 is a "theme" (very much ripping off CGP Grey's idea) and is just an incentive, a reminder, a nudge in the right approach instead of a set goal that is or isn't too dreading

Anyway, thank you for the read! I have no idea why you would read this, but hopefully it has been worth your time. See you in a year!
