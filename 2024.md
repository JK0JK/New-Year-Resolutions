# 2024 resolutions

## ~~1. Get a 3D printer~~

~~I've wanted a 3D printer for a long time. It will help with prototyping for projects I want to make, replace parts of things that are currently broken (my headphones have plastic parts that snapped, but they are impeccable otherwise, for example), and just other cool stuff other people have made (hextraction, I'm looking at you).~~

~~**UPDATE:** Ordered an Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo on Amazon. This printer is supposedly fast and beginner friendly, and was recommended to me by a friend I have a lot of respect for. It is also relatively cheap (despite the markup price you would get from Amazon without Prime). I also ordered 4 Kgs of PLA filament (2 PLA+, 2 PLA) to test out, as well as a set of replacement nozzles for different filament thicknesses as well as swapping them out when necessary. I will ~~strikethrough~~ this point when it actually arrives - even though Amazon is reliable in its deliveries (from what I'm told), I do not know how long it will ACTUALLY take, and how fast I'll be able to test things to make sure there are no problems or factory defects.~~

**UPDATE 2:** As of midnight of January 23rd, my first [3D Benchy](https://www.3dbenchy.com) is being printed. It will have finished printing by the time I finish writing this. I have big plans for this printer! Other than that, this is the first thing to be striked off the list! 

## ~~2. Fix Minigame Investigator's merge problems~~

~~I have not made a public release of any alpha builds of Minigame Investigator in YEARS. I have jotted down notes, I have drawn character concepts, I have written and re-written whole sections of the story (with.... admittedly not great dialogue....), I have written music pieces (that were lost when my last SSD corrupted, including the title screen music - make backups, kids!), but the biggest problem making things slow was... a merge conflict.~~

~~I will probably elaborate on a public blog post explaining why it's been so long, but while I was working on the next update, I thought of adding new instrument samples - which I still want to do, but in hindsight probably in a polishing phase that is NOT NOW - and I couldn't. Apparently, the tools that are available right now on [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) aren't in my old version.~~

~~It is a good practise to, when you're making a project that is a fork of another, to have a main fork that is literally just the current version of the project you're basing it off of and whatever features you are working on, you make a specified branch. It's clear that M.I. was my first experience with GitHub in recent memory, and of course, I did not know that.~~

~~Mistakes happen, we learn from them. Now I have to research how to get pokeemerald to be the new "root" (if that is even possible), and either abandon the current version and add the features I currently have (which sounds fast, but will leave that old branch stale) or I can fix the merge conflicts that have been the bane of my existence ever since I stopped working on M.I.~~

~~Needless to say, the first option is a lot better. I can't work on it during January because exams exist, but February sounds perfect.~~

**UPDATE:** I have been less and less interested in FNaF lately, and that's okay! However, that also means I have absolutely no interest in continuing development on a fan game of a game series that I don't care for anymore. If I manage to care about it again, I will go back and continue this project - it _is_ a shame to let it go - but I until then, I... don't really care for it. On June 6th 2024, I now mark this goal finished by lack of interest.

## ~~3. Read all of the FNaF books~~

~~I made [a YouTube channel all about FNaF](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair) and started working on it WAAAY back, but never got the time to research, write, voice and edit those videos.~~

~~I have recently gotten an e-book from a friend - Speed Reading by Kam Knight - and I'm hoping that THAT will make the research part of that process just a tad easier.~~

~~You would expect a guy that's making a fan game about the lore to have read all the books, but according to my estimations it would realistically take me around 123 hours of reading to complete them all, and I still have all the other stuff computer engineering students do like play videogames, do homework, study and hang out with friends (yes, surprisingly we have them). And you know, I want to be able to concieve maker projects (for which that 3D printer will be very useful)~~

**UPDATE:** Just like 2, I lost interest in FNaF. I might start caring about it again, and I'm not opposed to any discussion about it if someone really wants to gush about animatronics, but I don't really care enough to finish reading all of the books. I finished the silver eyes trilogy and left off at Gumbdrop Angel (the story AND the book) if I ever want to pick up from there. I have, however, replaced this goal with another one (check 7).

## ~~4. Get a job at a maker workshop~~

~~Last year I got to visit a workshop that teaches kids the basics of electric circuits, basic sewing, all these crazy things you can do with paper, little robots that you can learn to program with, chain reaction machines, etcetera and I felt like THAT was somewhere I could live in, you know? It didn't take me too long to be absolutely astounded and ask how I could apply for a job there, even as a university student.~~

~~I soon got the basics down, but I shouldn't apply until I am free to start, which I won't be until February. However, getting to work there as a part-time job is undoubtedly a goal for this year.~~

**UPDATE:** Not feasible with my schedules. I terminate number 4 for lack of realistic planning.

## 5. Make that video about my experiences with Linux

Since I changed my computer and decided to use Linux Mint as my OS, a recurring viewer of my streams, MasterSam4508, suggested I make a video about my experiences with Linux - where to start, what's better than Windows, what's worse, etcetera.

This is an amazing idea. I really, REALLY want to make that video. However, before that I still want to make videos for [Jackie's Despair](https://www.youtube.com/@JackiesDespair). In part, because I need practise with video editors here, in part because I also want to make FNaF videos on my free time.

**UPDATE:** I keep getting asked during stream about this. Seeing as I don't really care for FNaF much anymore, I need to make the videos about something else - and I am NOT a YouTuber, no matter how much I've thought about it and tried over the years and over many channels. If I do things, I did them; if I don't they're not there. I still want to do this, but we'll see when I manage to do them.

## 6. Make a push to become just a bit more secure

Last year, I decided that I wanted to be tracked... less. I know privacy is not completely achievable, but sometimes one push is all it takes.

**UPDATE:** Brave is now my browser of choice whenever I want to search things, because you can connect to the Tor network through it. That's not a huge jump in security, but it is a jump I hadn't done last year. I am now also making an effort to learn more about physical security.

**UPDATE:** Fuck Brave, I now just use the Tor browser for that. Plus I have a VPN which isn't as much of a jump in security as people say it is, but it's still something.

## 7. Read the first book of Yotsubato

I've been studying some Japanese here and there over the years, and, like many other people, one of the first manga I want to try to read is Yotsuba.

I have already bought the entire collection up until today (1-15) of yotsuba through ebay. I am now awaiting its arrival. I have already read some of the panels ini a pdf format, but having it in paper is _so different..._

## 8. Lose weight

It's... interesting that the first stereotypical resolution is one that only really came about halfway through the year.

During my time in college I have indulged in foods (and quantities of foods) that were not exactly healthy for me. As a result, I am now on the verge of obesity. I am not far into that range, but I am, as a matter of fact, obese. I want to change that. I have already started by eating less and drinking water between meals to not snack too much, but I still very much succumb to snacks and whatnot.

Thanfully, everything I ate too much of I can burn afterwards through exercise, but I really need to give more attention to my diet.

# And that's it!

1, 2, 3 and 6 are all "goal-starting goals", they obviously precede any REAL goals, but they're there for me to know what to do. They are not big (I already have the money for the 3D printer, have been saving up from my last jobs and gifts; making progress on Minigame Investigator is something I owe myself as a FNaF fan and reading the books is not unrealistic with a higher reading speed; that would also mean I would be reading at least 3+11+8=32 books, with Felix the Shark, 33, all in one year, which is more than some people's reading resolutions)

1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are actually boolean goals that do not result in anything else (I either read or didn't read the books, I either got or didn't get the job, I either made the video or didn't) but I'm willing to leave 5 for the end of the year so I can document "a year with Linux"

6 is a "theme" (very much ripping off CGP Grey's idea) and is just an incentive, a reminder, a nudge in the right approach instead of a set goal that is or isn't too dreading

Anyway, thank you for the read! I have no idea why you would read this, but hopefully it has been worth your time. See you in a year!

**UPDATE: June 6th** - I have given up on three out of the 6 goals: two out of lack of interest, one out of lack of planning. This is okay - I have also completed one goal, and the most important goal is being followed, step by step. I have also added two more resolutions to the list, one of which I have actively been pursuing for at least a week before placing it here.
