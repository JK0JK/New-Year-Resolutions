# Last day of 2024

As we move on to 2025, I want to do a review of this year.

A lot of last year's goals required purchases that in hindsight were not well thought out. Others just involved putting too much time into things I ended up not caring about enough for.
- Getting a 3D printer was great, but the house I live in isn't mine and so of course I do not get a say on whether the printer can be run in the first place. Thus the printer went unused most of the year.
- Resolution 7 required that I grew some more discipline before attempting it: Yotsubato is known for being cute and an accessible manga for beginners, but it's also widely considered that you should be N4 level at least before attempting it. I got the manga too early and grew disillusioned with Japanese after learning of things like Cool Japan and other propaganda techniques. It's only until 10 days ago that I started working on Japanese again, and of course that means i made little to no progress last year. Oh well.
- Resolutions 2 and 3 I gave up on because I stopped caring about FNaF as much. I still want to learn more about GBA programming someday, so maybe Minigame Investigator will come back from the ashes at some point? Don't count on it though - even during conception I had no ideas for interesting gameplay, and in the meantime the lore changed so much that the original story plan became impossible - or at least highly improbable.
- Resolution 4 was not great on schedules. Maybe during a master's degree? Not great during a batchelor's, though. I don't know how some of my colleagues manage.
- Resolution 5 wasn't exactly abandoned, but I would be lying if I were to say I didn't completely forget about it.

Having that said, some things have worked!
- Resolution 6 was just "a push to be more secure". I started using Tor for a lot of private browsing. I got PIAVPN (seems to be the more trustworthy of them) for hiding my ip when torrenting. I started using certain AI locally to double check things. There is still a lot about security I should have learned throughout the year, but I _am_ more secure than I was a year ago!
- I lost weight. Not a lot of weight, only about 5kg, but it's progress. Plus I started getting back with greater force lately.

Most of the resolutions were not achieved. Some because of unforeseen consequences, some because of very foreseeable lack of discipline. With that in mind, I'm fine with it: the two that I achieved were fine, and the ones I didn't still taught me something.

# And now for 2025

The resolutions in 2024 weren't all added on the same day. I think it is important to do that for 2025 as well, so I'm also adding a date in front of the resolution.

## 1. 365 days of anki (or Core 2k/6k) (Dec 31st 2024)

I got back into Japanese. I don't know why, honestly, but today is the 10th day in a row I've done anki reviews with the Core 2k/6k deck (with a duplicate of every card for listening practice). This mission will be completed if:
- I do my daily reviews without skipping a day
- I finish the Core 2k/6K deck

I don't expect to finish the deck that quick, but I'm leaving that here just in case I do. In either case I can see myself moving on to sentence mining afterwards and adding new cards to the deck, so really it should be 365 days of anki one way or another, but I still count it as a big accomplishment if I finish the deck before then, so might as well throw a little party for that. LOL.

## 2. Curb my swearing (Dec 31st 2024)

On Christmas, I played Faith: The Unholy Trinity and it was a really changing experience. However, and spoilers for whoever hasn't played this masterpiece, the last quote John can say before **MORTIS** in the final boss fight is a direct reference to the Epistle of James.

_"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.", James 2:26_

This and a lot of the other things in this game are very inspiring. It reminds me of how much I still seek that connection to the Almighty. While I'm still on the fence about _actually becoming a priest_ (lol), I can 

For those who know me or watched my streams, you will know that I am - and have been since I was a kid - very liberal with swears. A lot of them weren't directed to anyone in specific, but they were still not great. You'd expect that leaving a habit like this wouldn't be a work of faith - and while difficult, I'd agree with you. Having that said, this is a start. I will also look into whatever I can do for those arount me, but this kind of language specifically is unbecoming from someone who claims to follow Christ, and I feel is something that's holding me back either way.

## 3. Make my avatar for the LPD (Jan 1st)

Last year, I joined the LPD, the Local Police Department (former Loli Police Department) of VRChat. For those not in the know, the LPD is one of the more well known and culturally significant roleplay groups in VRChat. It's a group that looks to bring entertainment to any bystanders by creating chaotic scenarios. It's honestly one of the cooler communities out there, and I'm glad to have joined it.

Having that said, I want to make my own avatar for it. I am still not sure what it will look like, but I think I can do something really unique with it.

## 4. Continue losing weight (Jan 1st)

Most importantly, keep improving. I do not have very solid goals here - maybe I should - but I want both to lose a lot of the fat that I have but also become stronger and more flexible. With time, we will get there.

## 5. Make that video about sleeping in Half-Life (Jan 1st)

Last year I slept in Half-Life 2. I have a script, I have the editing skills. All that's really stopping me is time and sloth.

## 6. Figure out website (Jan 1st)

I joined a web 1.1 forum relatively recently and liked it a lot! I got inspired and started writing articles for my own website. Having that said, there is still a lot I don't quite understand: server-side includes on non-apache servers, elegant CSS for both old and new browsers, associating my domain name to it, etcetera. This year, I hope to bring some life to [lurkbeforepost.aftersleep.org](lurkbeforepost.aftersleep.org).

## 7. ?

Like last year, I'm leaving space for other stuff that comes up throughout. These have all been goals 2024 me started having in 2024 and left part of that burden for 2025 me. 2025 me is not a slave to 2024 me, he will have his own ambitions, and thus he'll leave his own resolutions throughout.

# That's it, get out of my comms
